# Personal Comments on Module 3 Challenge: Employee Payroll Tracker Modifications

## Overview

For this challenge, I made use of the Xpert Learning Assistant to provide templates for the functions required to run the site to the specifications of the acceptance criteria. There were a few slight modifications to the code that needed to be made to accomodate for previously established variables and arrays, as well as specialized log messages to replicate those found in the mock-up.

There were several methods introduced through these provided templates that were brand-new to me; it was exciting to learn and implement them!
